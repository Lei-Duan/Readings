# About this repo
This is a repo for my reading notes + reflections. \
It could be in English or Chinese, depends on my mood :). \
I will use [markmap](https://markmap.js.org/) (markdown + mindmap) to construct the notes. To visualize the mindmap, copy paste the markdown to [this](https://markmap.js.org/repl) page to render the hierarchical tree. \


# Some summarys ( last updated on 12/25/2020)

## General Topic Reading Notes:
### Title
Only making notes on your interested topic. Otherwise, it's a waste of time and friction for your reading practice.
### Subtitle
Original subtitle and good sentences. \
Relate the contents to one of a practical question and try to answer it. If you can't answer this question, then google it and add it as side note.(maybe you can find a related book :) ). \
### Final reflections
Optional, but only thinking triggers internalization. 

# Good Luck there. Keep reading.
