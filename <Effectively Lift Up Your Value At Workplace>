  ## Chapter 2 **work smartly**
- Peter Derrick: "It’s more important to do the right thing than to do things right"
- Understand the expectation.
  - Longer term: 
    - Do the right thing. Think the right problem. Prioritize the project.  
    - Don't be a "fireman". Sync from time to time with your manager to know the priority and stop working on other random things.
  - Short term: 
    - Understand the task detail and milestone. It's better to confirm before revamp all the work.
- Don't re-create the wheel
  - 80% of the problem has partially answered. Don't do the work from scratch.
- Be an improver
  - When you repeatedly finish tasks, think about: 
    - Can I do it with more choice? 
    - Can I do it faster? 
    - Can I improve the quality?
    - Can I cost less to achieve the same goal?
- Always do self-review
  - Three goods + two bads
  - It's like playing games where routine exists. keep reviewing and making notes, then you will be more proficiency.
- Make some change on the first 3 month
  - It's more accepted to see newcomer bringing in change.
  - People is paying attention on what you can do, and thus your contribution is emphasized.
