## Chapter 2 **work smartly**
- Peter Derrick: "It’s more important to do the right thing than to do things right"
- Understand the expectation.
  - Longer term: 
    - Do the right thing. Think the right problem. Prioritize the project.  
    - Don't be a "fireman". Sync from time to time with your manager to know the priority and stop working on other random things.
  - Short term: 
    - Understand the task detail and milestone. It's better to confirm before revamp all the work.
- Don't re-create the wheel
  - 80% of the problem has partially answered. Don't do the work from scratch.
- Be an improver
  - When you repeatedly finish tasks, think about: 
    - Can I do it with more choice? 
    - Can I do it faster? 
    - Can I improve the quality?
    - Can I cost less to achieve the same goal?
- Always do self-review
  - Three goods + two bads
  - It's like playing games where routine exists. keep reviewing and making notes, then you will be more proficiency.
- Make some change on the first 3 month
  - It's more accepted to see newcomer bringing in change.
  - People is paying attention on what you can do, and thus your contribution is emphasized.

  - Understanding the goal first, actions come after.
  - Classifying problems first, solutions come after.
  - Bigger picture first, details come after.
  - Think at your manager's level.
    - Employee --> tasks & execution; Manager --> project; Higher level --> company strategy and direction.
- **Positivity**
  - Praise
    - Don't be superficial.
    - Timely feedback.
    - "You did a good job" --> "Why is this amazing" --> "How I feel about this"
    - Good feedback --> show them out; criticism --> express them.
  - Motivate
    - Manager would like employee to give feedback / sync without being pushed.
    - When it comes to a point, communicate timely, give feedback timely, ask for help timely and share good news timely.
    - Make people feel that what they are doing is important to them and they own that.
      - Brainstorm makes people involved and feels the idea is "owned" by them.

      - Don't treat people with a whatever attitude or always with kind-hearted, of course not always offensive.
